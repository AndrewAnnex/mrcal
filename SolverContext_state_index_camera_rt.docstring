Returns the index in the optimization vector of the pose of camera i

Each camera is represented by 6 values: an orientation represented by a
Rodrigues vector, and an xyz world coordinate. i is given in the single
argument.

Note that camera 0 defines the world coordinate system, so the pose of camera 0
is not stored in the optimization vector, and thus passing i==0 is an error
