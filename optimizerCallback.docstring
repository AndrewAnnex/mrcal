Call the optimization callback function

SYNOPSIS

This exists for debugging. The main optimization routine in mrcal.optimize()
calls a function repeatedly to find a set of parameters that minimize the errors
norm2(x). For debugging, this function is available by itself here. The
arguments are largely the same as those to mrcal.optimize(), but the inputs are
all read-only. The only output is returned in the return tuple:

- x: a vector of measurements

- J: a sparse matrix of gradients of the measurements in respect to the
  parameters

Note that the optimizer uses some weights on the measurements, and some scaling
on the parameters. The values returned here are the optimizer-internal values.
To bring the jacobian into real units, call solver_context.pack(J)

See mrcal.optimize() for a description of the arguments
