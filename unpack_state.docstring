Converts an unscaled, unitless state vector to one with real units

In order to make the solver well-behaved, we scale all variables in the state
vector before passing data to the solver. The solver thus sees only unitless
data. I call this "unscaled" or "packed".

This function takes a unitless numpy array of shape (...., Nstate), and applies
scaling to it. The result is real-unit data
