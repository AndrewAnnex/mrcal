#+TITLE: mrcal roadmap
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

* New, big features being considered for a future release
- Triangulation in the optimization loop. This will allow efficient SFM since
  the coordinates of each observed 3D point don't need to be explicitly
  optimized as part of the optimization vector. This should also allow
  calibrating extrinsics separately from intrinsics, while propagating all the
  sources of uncertainty through to the eventual triangulation. This is being
  developed in the [[https://github.com/dkogan/mrcal/tree/2022-06--triangulated-solve][=2022-06--triangulated-solve= branch]]

- Non-central projection support. At this time, mrcal assumes that all
  projections are /central/: all rays of light are assumed to intersect at a
  single point (the origin of the camera coordinate system). So $k \vec v$
  projects to the same $\vec q$ for any $k$. This is very convenient, but not
  completely realistic. Support for /non-central/ lenses will make possible more
  precise calibrations of all lenses, but especially wide ones. This is being
  developed in the [[https://github.com/dkogan/mrcal/tree/noncentral][=noncentral= branch]]

- Richer board-shape model. Currently mrcal can solve for an axis-aligned
  paraboloid board shape. This is better than nothing, but experiments indicate
  that real-world board warping is more complex than that. A richer board-shape
  model will make mrcal less sensitive to imperfect chessboards, and will reduce
  that source of bias. This is being developed in the [[https://github.com/dkogan/mrcal/tree/richer-board-shape][=richer-board-shape=
  branch]], but this has the least priority of any ongoing work

* Things that should be fixed, but that I'm not actively thinking about today
** Algorithmic
*** Uncertainty quantification
- The input noise should be characterized better. Currently we use the
  distribution from the optimal residuals. This feels right, but the empirical
  distribution isn't entirely gaussian. Why? There's an [[https://github.com/dkogan/mrgingham/blob/master/mrgingham-observe-pixel-uncertainty][attempt]] to quantify the
  input noise directly in mrgingham. Does it work? Does that estimate agree with
  what the residuals tell us? If not, which is right? If a better method is
  found, the =observed_pixel_uncertainty= should come back as something the user
  passes in.

- Can I quantify heteroscedasticity to detect model errors? In the [[file:tour-initial-calibration.org][tour of mrcal]]
  the human observer can clearly see patterns in the residuals. Can these
  patterns be detected automatically to flag these issues, especially when
  they're small and not entirely obvious? Do I want a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_test]["white test"]]?

- As desired, we currently report high uncertainties in imager regions with no
  chessboards. When using a splined model, the projection in those regions is
  controlled entirely by the regularization terms, so we report high
  uncertainties there only because of the moving extrinsics. This isn't a great
  thing to rely on, and could break if I have some kind of surveyed calibration
  (known chessboard and/or camera poses).

*** Differencing
Fitting of the implied transformation is key to computing a diff, and various
details about how this is done could be improved. Currently mrcal computes this
from a fit. The default behavior of [[file:mrcal-show-projection-diff.html][=mrcal-show-projection-diff=]] is to use the
whole imager, using the uncertainties as weights. This has two problems:

- If using a splined model, this is slow
- If using a lean model, the overly-optimistic uncertainties you get from lean
  models tend to poison the fit, as seen in the [[file:differencing.org::#fit-weighting][documentation]].

*** Triangulation
- Currently I have a routine to compute projection uncertainty. And a separate
  routine to compute triangulation uncertainty. It would be nice to have a
  generic monocular uncertainty routine that is applicable to those and more
  cases. Should I be computing the uncertainty of a stabilized, normalized
  stereographic projection of $\mathrm{unproject}\left(\vec q\right)$? Then I
  could do monocular tracking with uncertainties. Can I derive the existing
  uncertainty methods from that one?

- As noted on the [[file:triangulation.org::#triangulation-problems-as-infinity][triangulation page]], some distributions become non-gaussian
  when looking at infinity. Is this a problem? When is it a problem? Should it
  be fixed? How?

*** [[file:splined-models.org][Splined models]]
- It's currently not clear how to choose the spline order (the =order=
  configuration parameter) and the spline density (the =Nx= and =Ny=
  parameters). There's some trade-off here: a quadratic spline needs denser
  knots. An initial study of the effects of spline spacings appears [[file:splined-models.org::#splined-models-uncertainty-wiggles][here]]. Can
  this be used to select the best spline configuration? We see that the
  uncertainty oscillates, with peaks at the knots. The causes and implications
  of this need to be understood better

- The current regularization scheme is iffy. More or less mrcal is using simple
  L2 regularization. /Something/ is required to tell the solver what to do in
  regions of no data. The transition between "data" and "no-data" regions is
  currently aphysical, as described in the [[file:splined-models.org::#splined-non-monotonicity][documentation]]. Changing the
  regularization scheme to pull towards the mean, and not towards 0 /could/
  possibly fix this. An [[https://github.com/dkogan/mrcal/commit/c8f9918023142d7ee463821661dc5bcc8f770b51][earlier attempt]] to do that was reverted because any
  planar splined surface would have "perfect" regularization, and that was
  breaking things (crazy focal lengths would be picked). But now that I'm
  locking down the intrinsics core when optimizing splined models, this isn't a
  problem anymore, so maybe that approach should be revisited.

*** Outlier rejection
- The current outlier-rejection scheme is simplistic. A smarter approach is
  available in [[https://github.com/dkogan/libdogleg/][=libdogleg=]] (Cook's D and Dima's variations on that). Bringing
  those in could be good

- Outlier rejection is currently only enabled for chessboard observations.
  It should be enabled for discrete points as well

*** Stereo
- A pre-filter should be added to the [[file:mrcal-stereo.html][=mrcal-stereo=]] tool to enhance the edges
  prior to stereo matching. A patch to add an early, untested prototype:

- Currently a stereo pair arranged axially (one camera in front of the other)
  cause mrcal to fail. But it could work: the rectified images are similar to a
  polar transform of the input.

*** [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-estimate_monocular_calobject_poses_Rt_tocam][=mrcal.estimate_monocular_calobject_poses_Rt_tocam()=]]
An early stage of a calibration run generates a rough estimate of the chessboard
geometry. Internally this is currently assuming a pinhole model, which is wrong,
and currently requires an [[https://github.com/dkogan/mrcal/commit/6d78379][ugly hack]]. This does appear to work fairly well, but
it should be fixed

** Software
*** Stereo
- The [[file:mrcal-stereo.html][=mrcal-stereo=]] tool should be able to estimate the field of view
  automatically: the user should not be required to pass =--az-fov-deg= and
  =--el-fov-deg=

*** Uncertainty
- Currently [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-triangulate][=mrcal.triangulate()=]] broadcasts nicely, while
  [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-projection_uncertainty][=mrcal.projection_uncertainty()=]] does not. It would be nice if it did and if
  its API resembled that of [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-triangulate][=mrcal.triangulate()=]]

*** Misc
- [[file:mrcal-show-geometry.html][=mrcal-show-geometry=]] tool: the [[file:mrcal-stereo.html][=mrcal-stereo=]] tool produces a field-of-view
  visualization. This should be made available in the Python API and in the
  [[file:mrcal-show-geometry.html][=mrcal-show-geometry=]] tool

- [[https://github.com/dkogan/mrcal/blob/master/analyses/dancing/dance-study.py][=dance-study.py=]]: if asked for chessboards that are too close, the tool goes
  into an infinite loop as it searches for chessboard poses that are fully
  visible by the camera. Something smarter than an infinite loop should happen

- Warnings in [[https://github.com/dkogan/mrcal/blob/master/mrcal.c][=mrcal.c=]]: there are a number of warnings in [[https://github.com/dkogan/mrcal/blob/master/mrcal.c][=mrcal.c=]] tagged with
  =// WARNING= that should eventually be addressed. This has never been
  urgent-enough to deal with. But someday

- viz tools should accept =--vectorfield= /and/ =--vector-field=
