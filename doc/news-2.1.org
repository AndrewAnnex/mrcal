* New in mrcal 2.1
This is a /very/ minor release, made primarily to facilitate the push to Debian.
Updates:

- Lots of minor documentation improvements. These appear on [[http://mrcal.secretsauce.net][the website]]
- Visualization functions use more legible colors to display the
  valid-intrinsics region
- Python library imports =cv2= only where necessary, which dramatically speeds
  up all the tools where =cv2= isn't used
- [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-r_from_R][=mrcal.r_from_R()=]] works better with small rotations. Near-identity rotations
  now report correspondingly-small =r=, rather than 0

* Migration notes 2.0 -> 2.1
This is a /very/ minor release, and is 99.9% compatible. The only incompatible
update:

- [[file:mrcal-python-api-reference.html#-annotate_image__valid_intrinsics_region][=mrcal.annotate_image__valid_intrinsics_region()=]] draws in green by default
  for consistency with other functions
