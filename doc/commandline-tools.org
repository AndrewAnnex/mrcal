#+TITLE: mrcal commandline tools

A number of commandline tools are available for common tasks. If you're just
using mrcal to calibrate some cameras, you may not need anything else.

- [[file:mrcal-calibrate-cameras.html][=mrcal-calibrate-cameras=]]: Calibrate N cameras. This is the main tool to solve
  "calibration" problems.
- [[file:mrcal-show-projection-diff.html][=mrcal-show-projection-diff=]]: Visualize the difference in projection between N
  models
- [[file:mrcal-show-projection-uncertainty.html][=mrcal-show-projection-uncertainty=]]: Visualize the expected projection error
  due to uncertainty in the calibration-time input
- [[file:mrcal-show-valid-intrinsics-region.html][=mrcal-show-valid-intrinsics-region=]]: Visualizes the region where a model's
  intrinsics are valid
- [[file:mrcal-is-within-valid-intrinsics-region.html][=mrcal-is-within-valid-intrinsics-region=]]: Augments a vnlog of pixel
  coordinates with a column indicating whether or not each point lies within
  the valid-intrinsics region
- [[file:mrcal-convert-lensmodel.html][=mrcal-convert-lensmodel=]]: Fits the behavior of one lens model to another
- [[file:mrcal-show-geometry.html][=mrcal-show-geometry=]]: Shows a visual representation of the geometry
  represented by some camera models on disk, and optionally, the
  chessboard observations used to compute that geometry
- [[file:mrcal-show-distortion-off-pinhole.html][=mrcal-show-distortion-off-pinhole=]]: visualize the deviation of a specific
  lens model from a pinhole model
- [[file:mrcal-show-splined-model-surface.html][=mrcal-show-splined-model-surface=]]: visualize the surface and knots used in
  the specification of splined models
- [[file:mrcal-reproject-image.html][=mrcal-reproject-image=]]: Given image(s) and lens model(s), produces a new set
  of images that observe the same scene with a different model. Several flavors
  of functionality are included here, such as undistortion-to-pinhole,
  re-rotation, and remapping to infinity.
- [[file:mrcal-reproject-points.html][=mrcal-reproject-points=]]: Given two lens models and a set of pixel coodinates,
  maps them from one lens model to the other
- [[file:mrcal-graft-models.html][=mrcal-graft-models=]]: Combines the intrinsics of one cameramodel with the
  extrinsics of another
- [[file:mrcal-to-cahvor.html][=mrcal-to-cahvor=]]: Converts a model stored in the native =.cameramodel= file
  format to the =.cahvor= format. This exists for compatibility only, and does
  not touch the data: any lens model may be used
- [[file:mrcal-to-cameramodel.html][=mrcal-to-cameramodel=]]: Converts a model stored in the =.cahvor= file format
  to the =.cameramodel= format. This exists for compatibility only, and does not
  touch the data: any lens model may be used
- [[file:mrcal-cull-corners.html][=mrcal-cull-corners=]]: Filters a corners.vnl on stdin to cut out some points
