Converts a real-unit state vector to an unscaled, unitless one

In order to make the solver well-behaved, we scale all variables in the state
vector before passing data to the solver. The solver thus sees only unitless
data. I call this "unscaled" or "packed".

This function takes a real-unit numpy array of shape (...., Nstate), and scales
it to produce unitless data
