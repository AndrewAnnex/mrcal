Returns whether a model has a fx,fy,cx,cy core

SYNOPSIS

    print mrcal.modelHasCore_fxfycxcy('LENSMODEL_OPENCV4')

    True

I support a number of lens models. The traditional, parametric ones have a
4-value core at the start of the parameter list: focal lengths in x and y, and
the optical axis pixel also in x and y. This function returns True for these
models. The richer, interpolated models are structured differently, have no
core, and this function returns False for them
